# Rice Leaf Disease Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project is a machine learning model that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect diseases in rice leaves. 

## Project Description

Rice is a staple food for a significant part of the world's population. However, diseases in rice crops can lead to significant losses in yield. Early detection of these diseases can help prevent these losses and increase productivity.

This project aims to provide a solution for early detection of rice leaf diseases. It uses a **CNN-based machine learning model** to classify images of rice leaves into different categories based on the type of disease present.

The model has been trained on a dataset of images of rice leaves, with various common diseases such as **Bacterial leaf blight**, **Brown spot**, and **Leaf smut**. The CNN learns features from these images and uses them to predict the disease present in new, unseen images.

## Key Features

- Image Classification: Classify images of rice leaves into different categories based on the disease present.
- CNN Model: Uses a Convolutional Neural Network model for image classification.
- Early Disease Detection: Helps in early detection of rice leaf diseases, potentially saving crops from significant damage.

## Technologies Used

- Machine Learning: The backbone of this project, used for predicting the category of the disease.
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): A class of deep learning neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery.
